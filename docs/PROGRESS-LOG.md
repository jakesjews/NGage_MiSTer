# N-Gage QD MiSTer core: progress log

Newest entries at the bottom. Each entry says what was done, what was
found, and what comes next. Research material lives in `research/`
(untracked); this log is the tracked record.

## 2026-10-19

### Setup
- Renamed the MiSTer template to `NGage.*`; added `build.sh` (Quartus in
  Docker on `ubuntu`, or CrossOver locally), `deploy.sh`, and
  `tools/report_timing.tcl`. `research/` is gitignored.

### Research (agents, all written up under `research/`)
- `research/hardware/`: Nokia RH-29/RH-47/NEM-4 service manuals and
  schematics. **The N-Gage QD has no OMAP1510.** The only processor is
  Nokia's UPP_WD2 ASIC (D100, V3.2E): an ARM9 MCU at up to 104 MHz plus a
  DSP and control logic, running both Symbian and the GSM stack.
  - 16 MB SDRAM (K4M28163, 16-bit, 104 MHz).
  - Two muxed burst NOR flashes: K8S2815ETA 16 MB on CS0 and K8S6415ETA
    8 MB on CS1.
  - Display: 176x208 module (Nokia 4850819, "GD82") on an 8-bit 8080 bus
    with its own controller and frame memory. The controller IC is unknown.
  - Keypad: 6x5 matrix on UPP_WD2 GPIOs, scanned in software.
  - Audio: PCM over EarData to the UEMK codec; no separate DSP chip on the QD.
  - MMC: 1-bit, 8.66 MHz.
- `research/symbian/`, `research/firmware/`: EKA1 ROM format, firmware
  versions, Phoenix flash-file format, game cards (per-title CID; the core
  must present real CID/CSD/OCR).
- A 2002 Nokia paper calls the chip a "130 MHz ARM925 MCU" with "the
  structure of TI OMAP". The boot code's CP15 use agrees (see below), so
  the OMAP5910 docs in `research/omap/` may apply block by block.
- `research/arm925t/`, `research/fpga-cores/`: ZAP is the recommended
  fabric CPU base (only open core with an ARMv4 MMU); the runner-up is
  Robert Peip's ARM9 lineage.
- `research/hps-hybrid/`, `research/bench-hps/`: QEMU-class emulation of
  an ARM9 on the MiSTer's Cortex-A9 measured about 9 MIPS, about 4-8x too
  slow. Native execution on CPU1 under a supervisor is feasible. The
  unmodified framework gives the core only DDR3 and a vsync IRQ toward
  the HPS, so a hybrid would need DDR3 mailboxes and polling.
- Prior art: MiSTer forum thread t=10933 (2026-10-04, user "Nortido"):
  an N-Gage core with the ARM on the HPS's second A9 and peripherals in
  the fabric, with no source posted.

### Decisions (user)
- Download RH-29 v4.60 firmware for development: approved. Files are in
  `research/firmware/images/`, never committed.
- CPU path (fabric vs HPS): decide after reverse engineering.

### Firmware findings (RH-29 v4.60)
- Phoenix data package from archive.org `Nokia_DCT4_firmwares` (range
  fetch), and the SDumper ROM dump from `symbian-firmware-dumps`.
- `tools/fls2bin.py` converts the MCU file `RH2946.0C1` and the language
  pack `RH2946.0S5` into flat NOR images.
  - MCU: CS0 0x000000-0xEFFFFF and CS1 0x2000000-0x2269FFF.
  - Language pack: CS0 0xF00000-0xF8EFFF and CS1 0x2330000-0x23FFFFF.
- The Symbian TRomHeader is at flash 0. The XIP ROM (0x1170000 bytes) is
  CS0[0..0xEFFFFF] + CS1[0..0x26FFFF] at virtual 0x50000000. It matches
  the on-device dump except in two places:
  - 0x12C-0x163: 56 per-phone bytes after the marker "KaeP". The flash
    file leaves them out.
  - **0xA000-0x310FFF is encrypted in flash** and plain Thumb code on the
    device. It is not the published S40 DCT4 scramble, and no GF(2)
    polynomial fits it. Over a zero run the pad looks random, which
    suggests an address-tweaked cipher. It is unknown whether the
    hardware decrypts on the fly or the boot code decrypts into RAM.
- `tools/romhdr.py`: EKA1 header pointers lead to the file's TRomEntry.
  Kernel `ekern.exe` code is at 0x5031B000; the variant is `ecust.dll`.
  Drivers: lcd.ldd, LCDDEV.DLL, medmmc.pdd, epbus.dll, ekeyb.dll,
  euart1.pdd, medint.pdd, btldd.ldd, rtc.dll.
- Boot code (flash 0-0xA000, plain):
  - It sets CP15 control to 0x1272 (alignment faults on) and DACR to
    0x55555557, and cleans the D-cache with c7,c10,0. That operation is
    ARM925T-only, so the core is an ARM925T.
  - It uses MD5 constants, likely the program-code check.
  - It probes the CS1 flash ID: Intel 0x89/0x8874, or Samsung 0xEC with
    device 0x22F2/0x22FA, or AMD 0x01 with device 0x277E.

### Reference model (QEMU)
- `model/`: a QEMU v11.1.2 machine `ngage-qd`.
  - `model/hw/ngage.c`: the board, plus a probe that logs every unclaimed
    access with the exact guest PC.
  - `model/hw/ngage_flash.c`: AMD command-set NOR.
  - `model/build.sh` clones and builds QEMU into `model/.qemu-src` and
    `model/.build`. `model/run.sh -t 5` runs the firmware and writes logs
    to `model/.out/`.
- The physical map learned so far from running the boot code:
  - 0x00000000: CS0 flash. 0x02000000: CS1 flash.
  - 0x08000000: memory-controller registers. The boot code writes
    0x7037F800, 0xB2950489, 0x37, and 0x20202112 at +0x10 and +0x14.
  - 0x0A000000: SDRAM, 16 MB. The boot code memory-tests it at 0x264.
  - 0x0C000000: on-chip RAM. Flash routines are copied to 0x0C004748
    and run there. The size is unknown; 256 KB is mapped.
  - 0x0C120000 and up, 0x0C150004: registers. Symbian maps this space
    at virtual 0x58000000.
  - 0x04000000: touched during boot (next to investigate).
- Current state: the boot polls a register at 0x0C1200xx (about 200k
  reads).

### Next
1. Model the register at 0x0C1200xx so boot continues. Keep iterating on
   the probe log and documenting each register in `docs/UPP_WD2.md`.
2. Find how the encrypted region is decrypted. Look in the boot code
   around the MD5 check and the 0x0C12xxxx/0x0C15xxxx registers.
3. Then the shared fabric peripherals with Verilator tests, then the CPU
   path decision.
